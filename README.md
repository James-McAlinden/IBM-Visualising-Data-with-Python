# IBM-Visualising-Data-with-Python

In this course I learnt multiple ways to effectively visualise data. I used many data visualisation techniques and learnt how to create simple and advanced graphs/charts such as waffle charts, area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, word clouds, and choropleth maps.

Furthermore, I learnt how to use data visualisation libraries in Python, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly and Dash.

I also created interactive dashboards containing scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie, and sunburst charts using the Dash and Plotly libraries.
